# shelnet-notes
Collection of all my cybersecurity and other related concept notes, primarily for deployment on Shelnet.

## Notes
Every note is titled with this format:
year-month-day concept

Within each note, there is no said structure.
They are simply the notes I take during my study/learning sessions and are often unfiltered + unformatted.
