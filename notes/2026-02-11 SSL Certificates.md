# SSL Certificates

## What is SSL?
**Secure Sockets Layer**
- security protocol that creates an encrypted link between a web server and browser
- ensures that all data passed between them remains private
- technically succeeded by TLS (Transport Layer Security) even though the term 'SSL' is still widely used 

## SSL/TLS Certificates
Often contain important metadata, such as
- organization names, physical locations
- alternative domain names --> shows us related infrastructure
- validity dates (helps us establish timelines)

**Handshake**
User visits website : SSL handshake occurs
1. Authentication; ensures the server is who it claims to be
2. Encryption; establishing unique key to obfuscate data sent back/forth

## SSL vs. TLS
Technical distinctions between the two
