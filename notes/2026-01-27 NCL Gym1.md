### Metadata

Image Metadata: make sure to look out for these
- make/model of camera
- coords
- date created
- exposure time

### DNS Lookup

DNS Records: know them and what they do

DNSKEY:
- this DNS record holds the DNSSEC public signing key

-> DNSSEC: Domain Name System Security Extensions
- it stores the public key used by resolvers to verify digital signatures, also authenticates DNS data integrity (so it can prevent DNS spoofing and hijacking)
- prevents attacks like cache poisoning and man-in-the-middle attacks
- uses 'chain of trust' from root zone -> indiv. domain

AAAA:
- used to map hostnames to IPv6 addresses
- know A (IPv4)

NS:
- delegates a DNS zone
- basically tells internet where to look for that specific domain's info
- `ns1.example.com`

### Threat Intel

CVE: Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
- industry-standard
- publicly disclosed
- large large large list of cybersecurity vulnerabilities in software and hardware
