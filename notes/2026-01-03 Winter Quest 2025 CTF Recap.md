# Winter Quest 2025 Recap

## Tools Used
### Wireshark
- multiple .pcap files to parse through
- utilized "follow stream" to analyze network conversations
- discovered messages embedded in images via export objects
- discovered hidden messages using CTRL + F within packet contents
### Powershell (later used Kali Linux VM -> bash)
- used nano to review source code
- used grep to parse through logs
### Browser
- used to identify hashes
- used to run online JS compiler
- used for converting data types (decode ASCII)

## Commands to Know
- find + its flags
- grep
- GET POST, etc.

## Concepts to Know
- XSS - what it is, how to identify it, how to protect against it
- Obfuscation - how to identify different types of obfuscation, how to DEAL with those types
- Networking Layers - review OSI Model; understand switch vulnerabilities
- Review OWASP Top Vulnerabilities

## Final Thoughts
Overall, this was an amazing experience and I was so glad I was able to participate and dive straight into hands-on challenges. This was my first CTF **competition**, and I had way more fun that I thought. 

During the challenge, I definitely struggled hard with parsing through the .pcap files. However, by the 3rd .pcap file I was getting quite efficient at analyzing the TCP streams and finding the hidden message. I learned to use the "find" tool within Wireshark to look for common CTF flag names, such as key or password. 

Concept-wise, I was a bit unpolished. I will admit that a few of the questions I got based on pure luck. For example, the question regarding the network switch was answered purely off of my knowledge studying BRIEFLY for Network+, though I guess it worked in my favor. I know now just how wide the realm of cybersecurity is. This YouTuber I watch, Low Level, said something along the lines of "no one will ever truly master cybersecurity" purely based off of the fact that there are so much subcategories of it such as IoT security, network security, etc. I get it now. I definitely was knowledge humbled by this competition, but that motivates me even more to go out and TRY to learn everything.
