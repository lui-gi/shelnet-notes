how fast electrons move: **current**

electric potential: **eV**; energy an electron would gain if moved between two points 

(from higher to lower eV)
- current I, potential V
Ohm's Law: V = IR
R = resistance of voltage; offsets current
- think of it like water flowing through a pipe
- type of pipe (shape, length) determines the out-flow of water 
- electrons --> resistor

We use copper because it conducts electricity extremely well.
- when hit by the same current (flow of electrons), the copper will conduct electricity better than materials like glass or wood (more likely to go through the copper)
- as a result, there is now a current flowing through the copper

Traveling from higher eV to lower eV releases a lot of energy in the process

Calculating power in a circuit:
(I) ->- | R | --
P = IR^2 = VI

#look-up what causes electric potential (aka **voltage**) change? 

In between conductors and insulators:
--> Semi-conductors
- we use this materials to control the flow of the current. due to Eg = 0.1-3.0 eV
Semiconductors: Si, Ge, Ga, As, In, P, Ga, N
Semiconductor devices: Transistors, solar cells, muLEDs, TFTs

True insulators don't exist, given enough eV, electricity will travel through insulators

Heat + Light: both generated by photons

## Importance of Transistors
- the control the flow of electricity to perform calculations, data storing, signal processing
Basically, the building blocks of all modern electronics

Usage/Work
- using a small current/voltage to one terminal to control a much large current flowing between two other terminals
- this enables them to turn signals on or off, or boost signal strength
