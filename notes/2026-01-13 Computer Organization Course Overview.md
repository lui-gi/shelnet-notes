# Computer Organization Intro

*Note: first time using RISC-V instead of x86 as assembly / base material*

## Overview
- theoretical understanding of how computers work at the base hardware level (see [[2026-01-15 Transistors and Semiconductors|transistors]])
- lectures focus on theoretical foundation of computer architecture
- [[2026-02-08 RISC-V Assembly Macros and Subroutines|RISC-V assembly]] language

RISC: Reduced Instruction Set Computing
#look-up RISC-V vs. x86
### Labs
- 11, uses online RISC-V Emulator -> cpulator
- each lab is given Tuesday @ 12:00 PM, due Sunday @ 11:59 PM
- three submissions selected to present lab assignments, those who volunteer will receive 5 points of extra credit, 
- LIMIT - 3 VOLUNTEERS
*volunteer for free points, i love teaching*

## Exams
- one midterm, one final
- hand written
- class avg Fall '24 --> ~50%
